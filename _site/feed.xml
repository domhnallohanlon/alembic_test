I always try to fight back and lose. Obviously. I have been &lt;strong&gt;THINKING&lt;/strong&gt; to write on a topic for more than a month. Notice &lt;strong&gt;THINKING&lt;/strong&gt;. Just to stress that I am only thinking. Doing nothing about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While submitting a new post, I always tell myself &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I should write one post per week. Okay, at least one per 2 weeks, keeping in mind other scientific projects”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Good excuse right! I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day, while having a small-talk with a friend of mine, I mentioned “I was planning to write something on this topic”, that I have been thinking. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Well&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, he said&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“there is nothing wrong in making plans. You can make as many plans as you want.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Then my face turned like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/facepalm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;FACEPALM&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you see, this comment hides some meaning. We do not see any problems while making plans. Even if we expect to see some, many other problems show up when we actually working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, each time I sit to write, I face &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; problems and all these forces me to postpone the work. Two most dangerous problems, of &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt;, are &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Procrastination&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Distraction&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (PD). I am a &lt;strong&gt;PRO&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;PRO&lt;/strong&gt;crastination. Oh boy! I’m telling you. I love those tomorrows. Everyday, my today’s work would be postponed to tomorrow. And these tomorrows are a never ending chain. If I start talking about my distractions, this post will take you somewhere &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;off-track&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and you’ll be distracted. It is difficult for me to resist the temptation of thinking about the vast number of topics in the world which are completely useless to me. I start with topic-A and my brain quickly jumps onto some random topic-K which is no way related to the initial one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;then-this-happened&quot;&gt;Then this happened&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a daily routine, I postponed my writing and started wasting time on random topics on the internet. I stumbled upon a quote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;You can not edit a blank page&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hit me in the face. I felt terrible. I felt embarrassed. I know what I want to do. I know how to do. But, why it is not happening? I always imagine myself writing, but never initiated an action. How do I improve myself editing my writing without having anything on the paper ? This really changed my rest of the day. I grabbed a notebook and pencil and drawn an outline on what and how to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/outline.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;outline&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Added some details to the initial outline. Some more to the second one and so on. Drawn few cartoon pictures. All this while, I fought my temptations to procrastinate, to open a new-tab and waste time on some random internet page and finally made “When I hit by a quote on the internet and started writing..”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are also having the same problems like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;stupid&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; me, do not wait until something punch you in the face. Nothing is really important, if it is, you obviously find time for it.

Former deals with designing the small molecules in the laboratory, testing their activity ..&lt;em&gt;etc&lt;/em&gt;, while, later deals with analysing the data, writing programs and software tools to analyse the huge amount of biological data generated from various subfields of Biology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of hard work involved in transitioning from a Pharmaceutical field to Computational Biology. I was a Pharmacy graduate, now a Computational Biology PhD student. Keeping my story aside, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/geek_y&quot;&gt;Goutham Atla&lt;/a&gt;, who is, fortunately one of my seniors, also was a Pharmacy graduate, now a Marie-Curie Early Stage Researcher in Computational Biology at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.idibaps.org/&quot;&gt;IDIBAPS&lt;/a&gt;, Spain. Let’s read Goutham Atla’s story, in his own words, of how everything started with a laptop and a mobile phone and &lt;strong&gt;how he became a computational biologist being a Pharmacy graduate.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Before going into the story, I should tell that I come from a typical middle class family in India. I spent my childhood in a small village with less than 10,000 people, very close to nature. Later on when I was 16, my mother insisted my father that we move to a nearby town so that we have access to better education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;To cut short, when I was doing my bachelor’s degree in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;pharmaceutical sciences&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, I used to have a computer that was given by my uncle. I had requested my father to get me an internet connection, which he could hardly afford during that time. He had to think for couple of days and make many calculations about the household expenses, education for three children, rent for the house etc etc on a piece of paper. Finally, he agreed to get me an internet connection, which had a limited usage of &lt;strong&gt;2 GB&lt;/strong&gt; during day time and an unlimited usage after midnight to early morning (6am). It was a very big deal for me. It’s the major source to know what’s happening around the world, being in a small town.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It’s all miraculous. I got a carrier locked &lt;strong&gt;iPhone&lt;/strong&gt; from my friend when I was in my bachelor’s degree (around 2008/9). Of course, I could not afford an iPhone during that time, it was gifted. I was amazed by its &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;design, features and the operating system&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. I started reading about the iPhone and the company built it, &lt;strong&gt;Apple Inc&lt;/strong&gt;. There, I was introduced to &lt;strong&gt;STEVE JOBS&lt;/strong&gt;. I started reading about Steve jobs and fascinated by his story, the story of Apple Inc., his charisma, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;reality distortion field&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and his passion to change the world. Since then, I have been a big admirer of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jobs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As my iPhone was locked, I was searching a way to unlock it on the internet. I found a tiny tool, &lt;strong&gt;blackra1n&lt;/strong&gt;, which could jailbreak and unlock the device. I was curious to know who built this tool. I came across a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;17 years old hacker, called &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Hotz&quot;&gt;GeoHot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, who built the &lt;strong&gt;blackra1n tool&lt;/strong&gt;. I was totally blown away. How a 17 years old kid could make a software that could unlock an iPhone? This created a spark in my mind that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;nothing is impossible&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. While reading about GeoHot, I also encountered with the stories of people like Jay Freeman (Saurik).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thereafter, I started reading stories about the notable people in the computer programming. In that process, I read about &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steve Wozniak, Captain Crunch, Kevin Mithnik&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and of course &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bill Gates&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and few more. I used to watch documentaries, interviews and movies of them. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kevin Mithnik&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was the world’s most wanted hacker in 90’s. Again, reading about Kevin Mithnik, the rivalry between Kevin Mithnik and Tsutomu Shimomura, the way FBI, along with Shimomura caught Kevin Mithnik, all these storied made me more interested into the world of computer programing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, I graduated from my bachelor’s degree in pharmaceutical sciences. I had different choices to move forward in pharma field but the stories I read about people in computer science world had greater influence and inspired me more. I got to know the interdisciplinary domain called &lt;strong&gt;bioinformatics&lt;/strong&gt; where one can apply computational techniques analysing data in biological sciences and answer interesting biological questions. Further, I learned programming and Unix skills. I used to do a night shift job, where I had plenty of time to read and practice whatever I liked. After a year, I quit the night shift job and joined a research institute for very low pay but there I could learn techniques in genomics data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Following my passion to work on genomics data helped me to get one of the most prestigious PhD fellowships in Europe and to work on genomics of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;human diabetes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

I have been spending most of the time of my days thinking &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Am I worth doing Science?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. All thoughts are centered around this single question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.ucl.ac.uk/human-evolution/news/science-and-stress&quot; alt=&quot;Science &amp;amp; stress&quot; align=&quot;middle&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; class=&quot;inline&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been more than a month I started to hit on the rock, in the hope it will crack one day in the next 3-4 years. I started my PhD. Ever since I was in masters, I always thought of doing science in a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“never give up”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; way. I never thought it would be easy but I thought I can handle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting PhD, I worked as a Research fellow. During that period, I was confident, I thought I am ready to work on my longstanding dream. Eventually, I started applying for open positions and at last I reached Europe to begin. Relocating from one country to another (one continent to other) and adjusting to the new culture and environment is another layer of complexity in the process of achieving dreams. I thought these effects would be minimal and absolutely they are, compared to the stress I deal with the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought the confidence and the flow I developed before starting PhD would be constant. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;No, I am a kindergarten once again, yes, I am learning A,T,G,C.. once again&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s not the way I earned the grades in my masters or under graduation and It won’t be same again. It’s a different path.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Working for an experiment which already has a shape and working for an experiment designing on your own hoping it would give expected result are completely different.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The later case is an adventure with no confirmed, expected outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A puzzled brain with thousands of confusing thoughts on one hand and dealing with internal stress to settle down and find peace in a different continent on the other hand – ending up on the question &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Am I worth doing science?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The moment this pops up, I find reasons to stay focused, I convince myself saying it is just a phase, it will pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I am not the only one struggling with this phase. There are many like me. I know people dealt with it. We too can. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Giving up”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is not our mug of beer. At the end, it’s worth struggling, it’s a dream, it’s for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;love of Science&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Venu Thatikonda</name></author><category term="PhD, Research Life, Science" /><summary type="html">It’s again the other day.

The DNA that codes for an RNA, which in turn makes a protein, who performs the biological functions in the body. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;“What about rest of the 98 % ?”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the third quarter of 20th century, &lt;b&gt;Dr. Susumu Ohno&lt;/b&gt;, a geneticist and evolutionary biologist coined a term &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘Junk DNA’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; to represent this 98% of the non coding genome. As a natural human tendency, we generally do not look into something which was labelled &lt;i&gt;‘useless’&lt;/i&gt;. However, Dr. Susumu has contributed very significantly calling it as “Junk”, because of which much of the focus was on the coding part of the genome or very less attention has given to non-coding part. The research on the protein-coding genome has revealed important (rather causal?) mutations, structural variations of many common diseases. &lt;i&gt;Thanks Dr. Susumu.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, much of the so called “Junk DNA” also transcribed just like the protein coding part. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;“How much percentage”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is still an open question (more a debate?). It is in the 90’s  people started inspecting this large part of the transcribed non-coding genome for its function. In the early 90’s, one of the first non-coding transcripts, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;XIST&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; (a lncRNA) was discovered, with some variations from the protein coding transcripts. In the late 90’s, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;John Rinn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, now at Harvard, was serendipitously discovered a transcript lacking ORF, while probing for coding genes on chromosome 22 (at Yale University). This lead to the discovery of &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;HOTAIR&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; in the later years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Fast forward to the early 21st century ...&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we are in an era which evidenced the superfast development of the technology. The &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; technology has revolutionized many areas of the biology research, including understanding of the coding and non-coding part of the genome deeply. Unlike previous methods, NGS allowed to look into the genome of the many individuals simultaneously. &lt;b&gt;DNA-seq&lt;/b&gt; provided a way to get a global picture of mutations, structural variations of a particular cancer type or other disease by inspecting the genomes of large number of patients in a very short timespan. &lt;b&gt;RNA-seq&lt;/b&gt;, an excellent tool for exploring the whole transcriptome of a cell, assisting the researchers to catch the transcripts transcribed from the non-coding part of the genome. Many studies have already proved that these non-coding transcripts are involving in the regulation of gene expression and the expression of them is cell type, tissue, developmental stage specific, there is an increasing chance of using them as the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;diagnostic markers&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for many disease types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;Like proper planning is required to place the bricks in order to build a complete house, transcribed non-coding genome is having plans to control expression of genes and other gene activities in healthy and disease states as well. This clearly indicates &lt;b&gt;“Junk is not really junk, in this case it is important non-coding section”&lt;/b&gt; as we no more willing to call it as &lt;b&gt;Junk&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The DNA that codes for an RNA, which in turn makes a protein, who performs the biological functions in the body. “What about rest of the 98 % ?”

In the third quarter of 20th century, Dr. Susumu Ohno, a geneticist and evolutionary biologist coined a term ‘Junk DNA’ to represent this 98% of the non coding genome. As a natural human tendency, we generally do not look into something which was labelled ‘useless’. However, Dr. Susumu has contributed very significantly calling it as “Junk”, because of which much of the focus was on the coding part of the genome or very less attention has given to non-coding part. The research on the protein-coding genome has revealed important (rather causal?) mutations, structural variations of many common diseases. Thanks Dr. Susumu.

On the other hand, much of the so called “Junk DNA” also transcribed just like the protein coding part. “How much percentage” is still an open question (more a debate?). It is in the 90’s  people started inspecting this large part of the transcribed non-coding genome for its function.

‘Genomics’ vision

As Aubrey de Grey, co-founder of “Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence” (SENS), believes “if the technology develops with the current pace, the human life expectancy increases to 1000 years and the person who lives up to 1000 years is among us now”. I strongly believe that Genomics will have a major role in this context.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/assets/log.jpg" /></entry></feed>
